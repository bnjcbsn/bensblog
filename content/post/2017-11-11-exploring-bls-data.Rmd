# The BLS data availability  
I became curious about this subject following a tweet by a bank with an [infographic](http://ei.marketwatch.com//Multimedia/2016/12/02/Photos/ZH/MW-FB220_jobs_g_20161202093708_ZH.jpg?uuid=cd745c42-b89c-11e6-9b93-001cc448aede) regarding the November jobs report. I did a quick web search a day later and decided to make a project of this chart from [here](https://resources.onewire.com/finance-industry-news/november-jobs-report-falls-short-expectations/).

It dawned on me this public data may prove useful for a post as my professional work is intirely not public for sharing. I visited bls.gov to try to find out what is available and how to access it. There is a lot of data available and it's offered multiple ways. I always start out with a Google query and stackoverflow search. I discovered a package developed for this sake written by Kris Eberwein, [blscrapeR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blscrapeR/index.html).  
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blscrapeR/vignettes/Employment_and_Unemployment.html

The BLS site does offer text file downloads, and Kris' package uses that approach, but seems centered on using the API for the site. I'm still trying to understand any benefits gained from either method.  

# Download BLS data  
From the web search, a solution result that I chose is a stackoverflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36504590/reading-simple-text-file-into-r-bls-data) regarding how to read BLS text data directly in to R.  


My first attempt to download follows. Notice that I've loaded no packages yet. This is base R. I carelessly copy in some code from the previous post and make an error.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/oe/oe.datatype"
header <- read.delim(url, nrows = 1, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(df) <- header
head(df)
```

[Error in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, : no lines available in input]

I'll try that again, but include all results.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/oe/oe.datatype"
dat <- read.delim(url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(dat)
```

Hmmm, what if I skip the first row?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/oe/oe.datatype"
dat <- read.delim(url, skip = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(dat)
```

It becomes apparent to me that in my first successful read, the row names are actually the first column. I don't expect to see this and the SO post doesn't identify this. But the SO solution does make more sense to address this. I'm curious at this point about how to define this structure. I want the results of the first read, but with the row names in the first column and the first column in the second column.

Shit! All of a sudden, I can't download anything, drawing an error instead. [Error in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, : no lines available in input] Back to kuberwein's discussion. 

Observing this code for inflation.R:
```{r}
#Load file from BLS servers
temp <- tempfile()
# Add urlEXists here.
download.file("https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.data.1.AllItems",temp)
unlink(temp)
```

That worked!

What gives here? I have no idea why read.delim was working and then began failing. I may return to that at some point in the future.

Let's try a package, turning straight to the tidyverse. This first attempt works, but doesn't produce appropriate results.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_delim(url, delim = "\t")
head(df)
```
I researched my tidyverse options and decided to give readr::read_tsv a try.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/ce.datatype"
datatype <- read_tsv(url)
head(datatype)
```

I'm not sure what's going on here because there are loads of messages but the results look complete. I'm switching to readr::read_tsv from this point for loading these files. Moving along...  

There is extensive information provided by BLS on their text files [here](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/ce.txt), of course, in text form.The full list of text files available are found [here](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/).  

Continuing, let's retrieve the employment series data dictionary:  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/ce.series"
series <- read_tsv(url)
head(series)
```

Then download all series data, except that :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/ce.data.0.AllCESSeries"
allseries <- read_tsv(url)
head(allseries)
```

I'm interested in the first record of the series data, `r series[1,6]`


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/ce.data.01a.CurrentSeasAE"
series.01a <- read_tsv(url)
head(series.01a)
```
