# The BLS data availability  
I became curious about this subject following a tweet by a bank with an infographic regarding this November jobs report.

It dawned on me this public data may prove useful for a post as my professional work is intirely not public for sharing. I visited bls.gov to try to find out what is available and how to access it. There is a lot of data available and it's offered multiple ways. I always start out with a Google query and stackoverflow search. I discovered a package developed for this sake written by Kris Eberwein.

# Download BLS data  
A solution result that I chose is a stackoverflow post regarding figuring out how to read BLS text data directly in.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36504590/reading-simple-text-file-into-r-bls-data


My first attempt to download follows. Notice that I've loaded no packages yet. This is base R. I carelessly copy in some code from the previous post and make an error.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/oe/oe.datatype"
header <- read.delim(url, nrows = 1, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(df) <- header
head(df)
```

[Error in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, : no lines available in input]

I'll try that again, but include all results.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/oe/oe.datatype"
dat <- read.delim(url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(dat)
```

Hmmm, what if I skip the first row?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/oe/oe.datatype"
dat <- read.delim(url, skip = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(dat)
```

It becomes apparent to me that in my first successful read, the row names are actually the first column. I don't expect to see this and the SO post doesn't identify this. But the SO solution does make more sense to address this. I'm curious at this point about how to define this structure. I want the results of the first read, but with the row names in the first column and the first column in the second column.

Shit! All of a sudden, I can't download anything, drawing an error instead. [Error in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, : no lines available in input] Back to kuberwein's discussion. 

Observing this code for inflation.R:
```{r}
#Load file from BLS servers
temp <- tempfile()
# Add urlEXists here.
download.file("https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/cu/cu.data.1.AllItems",temp)
unlink(temp)
```

That worked!

What gives here? I have no idea why read.delim was working and then began failing. I may return to that at some point in the future.

Let's try a package, turning straight to the tidyverse. This first attempt works, but doesn't produce appropriate results.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_delim(url, delim = "\t")
head(df)
```
I researched my tidyverse options and decided to give readr::read_tsv a try.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "http://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/oe/oe.datatype"
df <- read_tsv(url)
head(df)
```

I'm not sure what's going on here because there are loads of messages but the results look complete.
